                <p>
                    Maybe you dont need the features they provide and just want to make something simple,<br>
                    maybe you need the performance but current engines dont provide that power,<br>
                    maybe you need full control over the entire source code but all you get is binaries,<br>
                    maybe you need a complex system thats hard to implement inside a complex engine<br>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>At the core of Project ORKA is an always evolving, community driven, modular code base, accessible to
                    everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h3>What is it for?</h3>
                <p>Every game built with Project ORKA will be 100% moddable, meaning that games can always be improved
                    and evolve even if the original developer ceases to work on it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h3>What is the goal?</h3>
                <p>Project ORKA is not meant for making cash or ripping off gamers like the big studios do, Project ORKA
                    is for the people who love making, modding and playing games.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
                <p>People that have seemingly simple ideas and want that executed as fast as possible to see where it
                    leads, whithout having to write a whole game from scratch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h3>What comes next?</h3>
                <p>At the core games are just software and that means that project ORKA not only applies to games but
                    all kinds of software.</p>
